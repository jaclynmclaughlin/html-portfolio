    <h1>Jaqui's Favorite Movies of All Time</h1>
    <h2>The movies I rewatch over and over again...</h2>

    <hr />

    <h3>Practical Magic</h3>
    <p>Simply the best fictional movie that depicts modern witchcraft, with magik, 
    a fun romantic mystery plot, and fantastic representations of female relationships.</p>

    <h3>The School for Good and Evil</h3>
    <p>A truly fantastic modern fairy tale that turns upside down the expectations and cliches, while also showing us that 
    romantic/sexual love isn't always the most inmporatant kind of love in someone's life.</p>

    <h3>The Jurassic Park Franchise</h3>
    <p>My go-to for exciting action adventure movies every time. Made a thousand times better and more enjoyable because dinosaurs.</p>
